# Project Environment Setup

This repository contains a Bash script to automate the setup of multiple Laravel projects on an Ubuntu server. The script installs necessary dependencies, clones projects from Git, configures Apache virtual hosts, and manages `/etc/hosts` entries.

## Features

- Installs multiple PHP versions (7.0, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2) and necessary extensions.
- Clones projects from specified Git repositories.
- Automatically adds entries to `/etc/hosts` to point project domains to `127.0.0.1`.
- Creates Apache virtual host configurations for each project.
- Sets appropriate permissions and ownership for project directories.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have:

- A Ubuntu server or system.
- `git` installed.
- Basic permissions to execute `sudo` commands.

## Installation
